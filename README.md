# Cymbiont

> **Self-organizing knowledge graph memory for AI**

You're organizing a conference. The keynote speaker just canceled. Two weeks out.

You open your notes, type out the situation. She was also moderating the afternoon panel. Her talk was anchoring the entire distributed systems track; three other speakers structured their talks as responses to her framework. You save the file. Cymbiont syncs it to the knowledge graph automatically.

You start chatting with your AI assistant: "Okay, we need a replacement keynote. Who do we know working on consensus algorithms?" Your assistant immediately pulls up the speaker outreach notes you wrote three months ago: the two candidates who said maybe-next-year, the one who couldn't travel in spring, the researcher whose work would actually pair better with the panel topic anyway. You didn't dig through old documents. You didn't copy-paste your notes into the chat. The context was already there, retrieved silently based on what you're discussing right now.

"Wait," you say, "if we bring in the researcher, doesn't that change the panel focus?" Your assistant surfaces the panel description from the website copy, the moderator's proposed questions from an email two weeks ago, the three panelists' talk abstracts. Everything connected. You didn't ask it to search; it knew what you needed. The panic starts to subside. You're not drowning in details anymore. You're actually thinking strategically.

As you work through the solution together (restructure the panel, move one talk to a different track, brief the replacement speaker on the themes), Cymbiont extracts the key decisions from your conversation and saves them to the knowledge graph automatically. The new panel format. The rationale for the track changes. The timeline for confirming with speakers. No "write this down for later." No manual bookkeeping.

For the critical details (speaker contracts, updated session times), you ask your assistant to record them explicitly to the graph with exact wording. The save happens asynchronously. You keep talking, barely a pause. Or you have your assistant update the scheduling document directly, where you can review it yourself later.

This is Cymbiont. A fluid workspace where human notes, AI conversations, and automated memory formation interweave seamlessly. Some users write their own notes and use their assistant primarily for retrieval and discussion. Others have their assistant draft documents while they focus on synthesis and decision-making. Still others work primarily through conversation, relying on automatic memory formation to build their knowledge graph organically. The interface adapts to how you think and work.

## Why Knowledge Graphs

Knowledge graphs give you explicit structure. Entities and relationships you can inspect, query, and traverse. Both human and AI build the graph together, contributing different perspectives on the same knowledge. The graph becomes the interface through which different forms of intelligence coordinate.

This enables reasoning over structure: discovering paths, detecting patterns, understanding how concepts relate. Your AI can traverse the network of what you've built together, finding connections you didn't know existed, surfacing relevant context based on conceptual relationships.

## The Vision

Cymbiont is infrastructure for collective intelligence through shared representation. Your notes, conversations, and documents become a living network. The AI traverses it, extends it, discovers connections within it. You contribute structure and meaning. The AI explores knowledge space in ways you can't. Together you build understanding neither could create alone.

## Using Cymbiont

### With Claude Code

Once installed, Cymbiont integrates seamlessly with your AI assistant through two automated hooks that run in the background:

**Context retrieval**: Every message you send triggers parallel knowledge graph queries using both your message and your assistant's previous response. Relevant entities and facts (typically 3 nodes and 6 facts per query) are silently retrieved and added to your assistant's context before it responds. This dual-query approach enables closed-loop feedback: your assistant's responses automatically load relevant context for follow-ups, and you steer knowledge exploration through your questions.

**Memory formation**: Every 10 user messages, a background process analyzes the transcript and identifies salient information to add to the knowledge graph. This also triggers on session ends, clears, and compacts, running asynchronously without interrupting your work.

At its best, Cymbiont fades into the background entirely. Your assistant appears to naturally recall past conversations and surface relevant context without visible tool calls or explicit prompting. The graph grows organically, and the memory system becomes invisible - just part of how your assistant thinks.

Cymbiont is memory augmentation for general-purpose AI. Use it for:

- **Software development**: Code alongside your assistant with full memory of your codebase, past debugging sessions, and architectural decisions
- **Research**: Literature notes, experimental results, evolving hypotheses
- **Writing**: Draft iterations, research sources, thematic connections
- **Custom agents**: Build AI agents with persistent identity and long-term memory

### Document Sync

Cymbiont can automatically sync markdown files from a corpus directory into the knowledge graph. Place your notes, documentation, or research in a designated folder and the system will ingest them hourly, tracking changes and creating diff summaries.

**Setup:**
1. Create a corpus directory for your markdown files
2. Configure the path in `config.yaml`:
```yaml
corpus:
  path: "/absolute/path/to/your/corpus"
  sync_interval_hours: 1.0
```
3. Files sync automatically on the hourly interval
4. Your AI assistant can manually trigger sync using `sync_documents()`

**How it works:**
- New files: Full content ingested as episodes
- Modified files: Semantic diff summaries added to graph
- Renamed files: Episode metadata updated automatically
- Deleted files: History preserved (append-only)

**Codebase integration for developers**: Tools like [code2prompt](https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/code2prompt) generate markdown codebase maps that work seamlessly with Cymbiont. Just dump the output in your synced corpus folder and the knowledge graph ingests your entire codebase structure. Cymbiont includes git post-commit hook templates (`hooks/post-commit.template.sh` and `hooks/generate_codebase_maps.template.py`) that automatically regenerate codebase maps after each commit, keeping your knowledge graph in sync with code changes. See `hooks/README.md` for setup instructions.

### Recommended Editors

Cymbiont works with any editor that uses local markdown files. Choose based on your workflow:

**IDEs** (recommended for most users):
- **Zed**: Fast, modern, written in Rust
- **VS Code**: Extensive ecosystem, mature tooling
- **Cursor/Windsurf**: Agentic IDEs with AI-native features

IDEs with integrated terminals let you chat with your assistant and edit documents in the same application, the most convenient setup for most users. Some prefer separate windows for chat and editing, which works just as well.

**PKM Apps** (planned compatibility):
- **Logseq**: Open-source PKM with graph view and local markdown
- **Obsidian**: PKM with local vault and extensive plugins

**Note**: PKM app compatibility is not yet officially supported. Cymbiont doesn't currently resolve block references (e.g., `((block-id))` syntax), so dumping an existing PKM graph directly into your corpus will result in raw reference syntax appearing in episodes. Block reference resolution will only be implemented if there's user demand. For now, we recommend manual migration of specific notes; your AI assistant can handle reference resolution during migration if you remind it to do so. Many users prefer starting with a clean knowledge graph anyway, as Cymbiont is a living graph with different usage patterns than traditional PKM apps.

**Text Editors** (lightweight):
- **Sublime Text**: Fast with minimap navigation
- **Neovim**: For terminal enthusiasts

**Writing-Focused** (non-developers):
- **Typora**: Clean markdown with live preview
- **iA Writer**: Distraction-free writing
- **Zettlr**: Academic writing with Zettelkasten features

### Usage Philosophy

Cymbiont embraces an append-only model inherited from Graphiti. Rather than editing existing knowledge, you add new episodes that correct or update previous information. The ingestion pipeline handles deduplication and temporal invalidation automatically. The knowledge graph becomes shared memory between you and your assistant, with no separation between "your notes" and "agent memory." Your assistant is the primary interface to the graph; avoid interacting with the database directly unless necessary.

**Best practices:**

- **Add liberally**: Graph search scales sub-linearly; don't be stingy with memories or synced documents
- **Use synced documents for content you'll edit**: Files in your corpus are easy to review and modify manually; conversational episodes become append-only memory
- **Follow PKM hygiene**: No log files, no bulk external sources - link to external resources instead of ingesting them
- **Be cautious with automation**: Homegrown scripts can easily dump thousands of files with unbounded API costs; the code2prompt post-commit hook (included in `hooks/`) regenerates codebase maps after every commit, but you'll want to filter out submodules or directories you've already indexed separately to avoid double-indexing the same code
- **Deletion is awkward**: See [Deleting Data](#deleting-data) section for details
- **Expect initial costs**: Your first corpus sync may cost $10-50 depending on size (assuming several hundred pages of notes), but costs stabilize quickly once you're only adding documents manually

The graph grows organically as you work. Treat it like a living PKM system, not a curated database. Add corrections rather than seeking perfection, and trust the temporal model to handle contradictions over time.

## Installation Instructions

### What You'll Need

- **MCP-Compatible AI Assistant**: [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/download) recommended (only officially supported agent at present)
- **Rust**: https://rustup.rs/
- **Python 3.10+**: For the knowledge graph backend
- **Neo4j**: Graph database
- **OpenAI API Key**: For entity extraction and semantic search

### Installation

**1. Install Neo4j**

```bash
# Add repository
wget -O - https://debian.neo4j.com/neotechnology.gpg.key | gpg --dearmor -o /tmp/neotechnology.gpg.key
sudo mv /tmp/neotechnology.gpg.key /usr/share/keyrings/
echo 'deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/neotechnology.gpg.key] https://debian.neo4j.com stable latest' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/neo4j.list

# Install
sudo apt update && sudo apt install neo4j
sudo systemctl enable neo4j

# Set initial password (using demodemo as default for development)
sudo systemctl stop neo4j
sudo neo4j-admin dbms set-initial-password demodemo
sudo systemctl start neo4j
```

**2. Install uv (Python package manager)**

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**3. Clone Cymbiont and build**

```bash
# Clone with submodules (includes bundled graphiti-cymbiont)
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Brandtweary/cymbiont.git
cd cymbiont

# Build Cymbiont
cargo build --release
```

**4. Set up the knowledge graph backend**

```bash
# Configure graphiti-cymbiont (bundled submodule)
cd graphiti-cymbiont

# Create .env in root directory (required for editable install)
cat > .env << 'EOF'
NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
NEO4J_USER=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=demodemo  # Default password set during Neo4j installation; change if you used different password
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here  # REQUIRED: Replace with your actual OpenAI API key
MODEL_NAME=gpt-5-mini                      # Main LLM for entity/relationship extraction
SMALL_MODEL_NAME=gpt-5-nano                # Small LLM for deduplication/attributes
EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME=text-embedding-3-small # Embedding model for vector search
SEMAPHORE_LIMIT=10                         # Concurrent LLM operations
LOG_FILE=/path/to/cymbiont/logs/graphiti_latest.log  # Optional: Customize log path
EOF
```

> **⚠️ Temporary OpenAI Dependency**: Cymbiont currently requires an OpenAI API key because the cross-encoder reranking model (used in chunk search) is hardcoded to use OpenAI's `gpt-4.1-nano`. We plan to make this configurable in the near-term, allowing you to use any model provider or disable reranking entirely.

```bash
# Install server dependencies with editable graphiti-core
cd server
uv sync
cd ../..  # Return to cymbiont root
```

**5. Connect to your AI assistant**

For Claude Code:

```bash
# Available across all projects (recommended)
claude mcp add --scope user cymbiont --transport stdio -- /path/to/cymbiont/target/release/cymbiont

# Or limit to specific project only
claude mcp add --scope project cymbiont --transport stdio -- /path/to/cymbiont/target/release/cymbiont
```

**6. Configure corpus path**

Create a directory for your markdown files and configure the path:

```bash
# Create corpus directory (or use existing one)
mkdir -p ~/Documents/cymbiont-corpus

# Copy example config and set corpus path
cd cymbiont
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
# Edit config.yaml and set corpus.path to your directory (must be absolute path)
# See Configuration section below for full details
```

**7. Install Claude Code Hooks (Strongly Recommended)**

The hooks enable automatic context injection and memory formation - without them, you must remind your assistant to search and save to the graph.

**Option 1: Point to cymbiont installation (Fastest)**

```bash
# Find your cymbiont installation (if you don't remember where you installed it)
find ~ -type d -name "cymbiont" -path "*/cymbiont" 2>/dev/null | grep -v node_modules

# Set CYMBIONT_PATH to the path shown above
CYMBIONT_PATH="/full/path/to/cymbiont"

# Create settings backup
cp ~/.claude/settings.json ~/.claude/settings.json.backup

# Add hooks to your Claude Code settings
cat > /tmp/hook_config.json << EOF
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 ${CYMBIONT_PATH}/hooks/inject_kg_context.py"
          },
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 ${CYMBIONT_PATH}/hooks/monitoring_agent.py"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PreCompact": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 ${CYMBIONT_PATH}/hooks/monitoring_agent.py --force"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "SessionEnd": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 ${CYMBIONT_PATH}/hooks/monitoring_agent.py --force"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
EOF

# Merge with existing settings (requires jq)
jq -s '.[0] * .[1]' ~/.claude/settings.json /tmp/hook_config.json > ~/.claude/settings.json.new
mv ~/.claude/settings.json.new ~/.claude/settings.json
rm /tmp/hook_config.json

echo "Hooks installed! Backup saved to ~/.claude/settings.json.backup"
```

**Option 2: Copy hooks to ~/.claude/ (Recommended)**

Copy hooks to your own directory for customization:

```bash
# Find your cymbiont installation
find ~ -type d -name "cymbiont" -path "*/cymbiont" 2>/dev/null | grep -v node_modules

# Copy hooks (replace /full/path/to/cymbiont with path from above)
mkdir -p ~/.claude/hooks
cp /full/path/to/cymbiont/hooks/*.py ~/.claude/hooks/
cp /full/path/to/cymbiont/hooks/monitoring_protocol.txt ~/.claude/hooks/

# Install hooks using ~/.claude/hooks/ path
CYMBIONT_PATH="$HOME/.claude"

# Run the same installation commands as Option 1, using $CYMBIONT_PATH
```

Then edit the files in `~/.claude/hooks/` as needed.

**If you don't have jq installed**, manually edit `~/.claude/settings.json` and add the hooks block shown above.

**Optional: Customize Monitoring Protocol**

The automated memory formation system uses `hooks/monitoring_protocol.txt` to decide what information is salient. The default protocol works well for most users, but you can customize it to fit your needs:

```bash
# If you copied hooks to ~/.claude/hooks/ (Option 2 above):
nano ~/.claude/hooks/monitoring_protocol.txt

# If you're pointing to cymbiont installation (Option 1 above):
nano hooks/monitoring_protocol.txt
```

**8. Add Cymbiont Instructions to CLAUDE.md**

Your AI assistant needs minimal instructions for using Cymbiont effectively:

```bash
# Navigate to cymbiont directory
cd cymbiont

# If you used --scope user
cat CLAUDE_INSTRUCTIONS_TEMPLATE.md >> ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md

# If you used --scope project
cat CLAUDE_INSTRUCTIONS_TEMPLATE.md >> /path/to/your/project/CLAUDE.md
```

**Important**: After adding, edit the CLAUDE.md file and customize the corpus path (`/path/to/your/corpus/`) to match your `config.yaml` settings.

That's it! Restart Claude Code and the automated memory system is active.

## Technical Overview

### Cymbiont Stack

```
AI Assistant (Claude Code, etc.)
    ↓ MCP Protocol (stdio JSON-RPC)
Cymbiont MCP Server (Rust)
    ↓ HTTP REST API
Graphiti-Cymbiont FastAPI Backend (Python, bundled)
    ↓ Bolt Protocol
Neo4j Knowledge Graph
```

**Cymbiont MCP Server**: Rust-based protocol adapter translating MCP's stdio JSON-RPC to Graphiti's HTTP API. Handles backend lifecycle, rotating file logging via autodebugger. Includes graphiti-cymbiont as bundled submodule.

**Graphiti-Cymbiont Backend**: Python FastAPI server (bundled with Cymbiont) providing LLM-powered entity/relationship extraction, hybrid search (BM25 + vector + reranking), and temporal reasoning. A fork of Graphiti with document synchronization and chunk retrieval features.

**Neo4j Database**: Graph storage with vector indices for embeddings, full-text indices for keyword search, and Cypher query engine.

### MCP Tools

**add_memory**(name: String, episode_body: String, source_description: Option\<String\>)
- Add a new memory episode to the knowledge graph

**search_context**(query: String, max_results: Option\<usize\>)
- Search for entities and relationships (default: 5 nodes, 10 facts)

**get_chunks**(keyword_query: String, max_results: Option\<usize\>, rerank_query: Option\<String\>)
- BM25 keyword search over document chunks (default: 10 results)

**get_episodes**(last_n: Option\<usize\>)
- Get recent episodes from the knowledge graph (default: 10)

**delete_episode**(uuid: String)
- Delete an episode by UUID

**sync_documents**()
- Trigger manual document synchronization

## Features

- **Persistent Memory**: Temporal knowledge graph maintains context across AI assistant sessions
- **Hybrid Search**: Combines semantic similarity (embeddings), keyword matching (BM25), and reranking (RRF/cross-encoder)
- **Entity Extraction**: LLM automatically identifies entities and relationships from text, JSON, or conversations
- **Temporal Reasoning**: Bi-temporal model tracks when facts were learned (`created_at`) vs. when events occurred (`valid_at`)
- **Automatic Document Sync**: Hourly corpus directory monitoring with intelligent change detection and diff summaries
- **Dual Retrieval Modes**: Semantic search for conceptual exploration (`search_context`) + BM25 keyword search for exact text with provenance (`get_chunks`)
- **Hook System**: Automatic context injection and memory formation via Claude Code hooks - no manual prompting required

### Configuration

**What you need to configure**: Set `corpus.path` to an absolute path where you want to keep your markdown files. All other settings have sensible defaults.

Copy `config.example.yaml` to `config.yaml` and set your corpus path:

```bash
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
# Edit config.yaml and set corpus.path to your directory
```

Cymbiont searches for config.yaml in multiple locations (first match wins):

1. **`CYMBIONT_CONFIG` environment variable** - Explicit override path
2. **`./config.yaml`** - Current working directory
3. **`cymbiont/config.yaml`** - Repo root (relative to binary - goes up 2 levels from `target/debug/cymbiont`)
4. **`~/.config/cymbiont/config.yaml`** - XDG standard location (recommended for production)
5. **Defaults** - If no config file found (corpus.path defaults to None, document sync disabled)

**Example config.yaml:**

```yaml
graphiti:
  base_url: "http://localhost:8000"
  timeout_secs: 30
  default_group_id: "default"
  # server_path uses bundled graphiti-cymbiont by default
  # Override only if using custom installation:
  # server_path: "/custom/path/to/graphiti-cymbiont/server"

corpus:
  path: "/path/to/markdown/documents"  # Absolute path to your corpus directory
  sync_interval_hours: 1.0

logging:
  level: "info"  # trace, debug, info, warn, error
  log_directory: "logs"  # Relative to binary or absolute
  max_files: 10
  max_size_mb: 5
  console_output: false  # MUST be false for MCP mode

verbosity:
  info_threshold: 50
  debug_threshold: 100
  trace_threshold: 200
```

### Data Model

### Three-Layer Structure

**Episodes**: Raw content units (input)
- Text snippets, conversations, JSON documents
- Timestamps: `created_at` (ingestion), `valid_at` (event occurrence)
- Metadata: URIs, content hashes, sync timestamps

**Entities**: Extracted concepts (automatically identified)
- People, organizations, ideas, technical concepts
- Summaries and embeddings for semantic search
- LLM-extracted from episode content

**Facts**: Relationships between entities (enables graph traversal)
- Example: "Rust PREVENTS data races"
- Embeddings for semantic search
- Temporal tracking and invalidation

### Ingestion Pipeline

1. **Submit episode** via `add_memory` (text)
2. **LLM extraction**: Identify entities and relationships using configured models
3. **Deduplication**: Two-stage process (fuzzy matching → LLM fallback) to merge duplicate entities
4. **Attribute extraction**: Generate summaries and extract entity-specific attributes
5. **Embedding generation**: Create vectors for entity names and relationship facts
6. **Graph update**: Save nodes/edges with temporal metadata, create episodic links
7. **Temporal invalidation**: Automatically expire contradicted facts based on timestamps
8. **Community detection** (optional, disabled by default): Cluster related entities for hierarchical summaries

### Retrieval Pipeline

**Default Hybrid Search** (used by `search_context`):
1. **BM25 keyword search**: Full-text indices for exact phrase matching
2. **Vector similarity search**: Cosine similarity on embeddings (60% threshold)
3. **Reciprocal rank fusion (RRF)**: Mathematical merging of BM25 and vector results
4. **Final ranking**: Return top results after reranking

**Optional enhancements** (configurable via search recipes):
- Graph traversal (BFS) for exploring connected nodes
- Cross-encoder reranking for precision-critical queries
- MMR (diversity optimization) to reduce redundancy
- Episode mention frequency for salience-based ranking

**Chunk Search** (used by `get_chunks`):
1. **BM25 keyword search** over document chunks (~256 tokens each)
2. **Optional cross-encoder reranking** for answer-relevance judgment when `rerank_query` provided
3. **Provenance aggregation**: Group chunks by source document with narrative ordering

**For parameter tuning**: See [GRAPHITI_CONFIG.md](GRAPHITI_CONFIG.md) for comprehensive documentation of all configurable parameters in the ingestion and retrieval pipelines.

### Backend Management

The Graphiti FastAPI backend starts automatically when the first Cymbiont instance connects. It continues running even after your AI assistant exits to prevent data loss during asynchronous episode ingestion. You can safely close your AI client without interrupting memory formation.

The backend terminates naturally on system restart. To manually restart for troubleshooting:

```bash
# Find process
ps aux | grep uvicorn | grep graphiti

# Kill
kill <PID>
```

Next Cymbiont connection will start a fresh instance.

## Deleting Data

Cymbiont intentionally makes deletion non-trivial to reinforce the append-only paradigm. If you find yourself wanting to delete data frequently, you're probably fighting the system's design. Add corrective episodes instead.

**Deleting conversational episodes**:
```bash
# Via MCP tool (easiest - your assistant can do this)
# Just ask: "Delete episode <uuid>"
# The delete_episode tool handles cleanup automatically
```

**Deleting synced documents**:
```bash
# Via curl (requires manual endpoint call)
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8000/document/<document-uri>?delete_episodes=true"
```

**Deleting specific nodes or edges**: Your assistant can use cypher commands to manipulate the graph directly, but we don't recommend it. Fine-grained data surgery goes against Cymbiont's philosophy - add corrections rather than rewriting history.

## Upcoming Features

- **Enhanced search**: Personalized PageRank graph traversal, learned edge weights via graph neural network
- **Graph maintenance**: Automated orphan cleanup and semantic drift detection
- **Multi-format ingestion**: Ingest PDFs, images, audio, and other file types beyond markdown
